		<p>
			I do not use third-party analytics tools, tracking scripts, social media plugins, or external

			All data transmitted between your browser and this website is encrypted using SSL/TLS
			technology. Appropriate technical and organizational measures are taken to protect stored data
			against unauthorized access, loss, or manipulation. However, I would like to point out that
			data transmission over the internet may always have security gaps and cannot be completely
			protected against access by third parties.
