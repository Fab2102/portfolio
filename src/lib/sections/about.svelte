		Hi, I’m Fabian – a <strong>Business Informatics student</strong> at WU Vienna with hands-on
		experience as a
		<strong>part-time developer</strong>. With a strong foundation in
		<strong>Python and Web Development</strong>, I combine technical skills with a strong business
		perspective, working on real-world projects where software meets strategy. During my time at
		Raiffeisen Bank, I’ve contributed to automation tools and internal services that make workflows
		smarter.

	<p class="mb-10 max-w-[95ch] px-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-800 sm:text-lg">
		I’m passionate about clean design, performance, and user experience. Whether building mobile
		apps or data-driven dashboards, <strong>I care about every detail</strong> — from thoughtful UI
		to scalable architecture. I’m constantly
		<strong>exploring new frameworks and technologies</strong> while turning ideas into polished, functional
		interfaces.
	</p>

	<p class="max-w-[95ch] px-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-800 sm:text-lg">
		Looking forward, I want to build tools that create real value — intuitive, helpful, and
		beautifully designed. I’m especially drawn to projects that make data more accessible or
		simplify everyday tasks through smart, user-focused interfaces. I believe in <strong
			>learning by doing</strong
		>, and I’m always up for challenging problems that push me to grow — not just as a developer,
		but as someone who builds with purpose and <strong>attention to detail</strong>. My goal is to
		turn good ideas into meaningful digital experiences.
