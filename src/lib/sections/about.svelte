		I’m currently pursuing a BSc in Business Informatics at the Vienna University of Economics and
		Business. As a member of the top 1% of BAWISO students in 2023/24 and honoree on the Dean’s
		List, I blend rigorous analytical training with a genuine curiosity for innovative solutions. My
		academic journey is anchored in Python, R, and data-driven methodologies that empower me to
		tackle complex challenges.

		Professionally, I’ve contributed to Raiffeisen Bank International’s Group Prime Services
		team—first as an intern and now in a part-time student support role. There, I develop and refine
		software tools focused on process optimization and automation, leveraging Python, Git, JIRA, and
		collaboration best practices to streamline workflows and boost operational efficiency.

		Driven by a passion for both technology and user-centric design, I’m committed to turning ideas
		into reliable, high-performance applications. Whether I’m mapping out a new feature or debugging
		a complex script, I enjoy transforming theoretical insight into practical impact—and I’m always
		eager to learn the next tool or technique that will sharpen my craft.
